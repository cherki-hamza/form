                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Care Instructions for Porcelain Countertops</h6>
                    <p>Porcelain countertops require specific care and handling due to their composition. Unlike full-body materials such as marble or granite, porcelain surfaces are more susceptible to damage from impacts, cleaning products, and improper use. Please follow the guidelines below to maintain the appearance and durability of your porcelain counters:</p>

                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Handling & Usage:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Impact Warning:</strong> Porcelain countertops are not full-body materials like marble or granite. Hitting or knocking the edges or surface of the porcelain can cause <strong>chipping</strong>, revealing the body underneath.
                            <br><em>Tip:</em> Avoid placing heavy or hard objects near the edges, and be cautious when handling items on the surface.</li>
                        <li><strong>Basin Cover Usage:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>It is recommended <strong>not to use the basin cover frequently</strong> in high-traffic areas like kitchens or often-cleaned spaces.</li>
                                <li><strong>Proper Care:</strong> When removing or placing the basin cover, handle it carefully to avoid hitting or scratching the porcelain. Any damage caused by improper handling will <strong>not be covered under warranty</strong>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Cleaning Guidelines:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Harsh Chemicals:</strong> Using strong or abrasive cleaning agents can cause <strong>discoloration of groutings and epoxies</strong> used around the porcelain countertops.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Recommended Cleaners:</strong> Use mild cleaning agents, such as diluted dish soap or a pH-neutral cleaner, to clean the surface and grout without damaging the finish or causing discoloration.</li>
                                <li><strong>Avoid Acidic Cleaners:</strong> Products that contain bleach, ammonia, or acidic compounds should be avoided as they can damage both the porcelain and grout.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Soft Cleaning Tools:</strong> Always use soft, non-abrasive cleaning cloths or sponges to avoid scratching the surface. For grout lines, use a soft-bristle brush to clean without damaging the material.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Warranty Disclaimer:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Chipping & Impact Damage:</strong> Any damage caused by hitting or dropping objects on the porcelain surface or edges is <strong>not covered under warranty</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Discoloration Due to Harsh Cleaning Agents:</strong> Damage to the groutings or epoxies due to the use of harsh or inappropriate cleaning agents is <strong>not covered under warranty</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>By following these care instructions, you can preserve the beauty and functionality of your porcelain countertops for years to come.</p>

            <!-- Care Instructions for Joinery Work (MR MDF) -->
            <div class="mb-3">
                <div class="">
                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Care Instructions for Joinery Work (MR MDF)</h6>
                    <p>For joinery work made from <strong>Moisture-Resistant Medium Density Fiberboard (MR MDF)</strong>, it is essential to maintain stable temperature and humidity levels to prevent warping, swelling, or shrinkage. Here are the ideal conditions:</p>

                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Temperature:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ideal Range:</strong> 18°C to 24°C (64°F to 75°F).</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid extremes:</strong> Do not expose MR MDF to temperatures below 10°C (50°F) or above 30°C (86°F) for prolonged periods, as it could affect the material's stability.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Humidity:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ideal Range:</strong> 40% to 60% relative humidity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Humidity levels above 70% can cause the material to absorb moisture, leading to swelling, while levels below 30% can dry out the material, causing cracks or shrinkage.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Cleaning Instructions:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Use Damp Cloth:</strong> Clean the surface using a slightly damp cloth instead of soaking it with water. Ensure the cloth is well-wrung to minimize moisture exposure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dry Immediately:</strong> After wiping, ensure the surface is quickly dried with a dry cloth to prevent moisture from sitting on the surface.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Harsh Cleaners:</strong> Do not use excessive water or cleaning products that could introduce additional moisture into the material.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Failure to maintain these conditions and improper care will void the warranty</em> on joinery products made from MR MDF.</p>

                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Care Instructions for LED Mirrors and Frames</h6>
                    <p>LED mirrors and their frames require specific cleaning and care practices to avoid damage. Mirrors, especially those with colored frames, can be affected by certain cleaning agents, leading to discoloration or degradation. Please follow these guidelines to ensure the longevity of your LED mirrors and frames:</p>

                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Cleaning Guidelines for Mirrors:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Harsh Chemicals:</strong> Mirrors can be damaged by strong or abrasive cleaning products, especially those containing ammonia, bleach, or acidic compounds.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Recommended Cleaning Method:</strong> Use a <em>damp cloth</em> to gently clean the mirror surface. This is enough to remove fingerprints, dust, and minor smudges without risking damage to the reflective coating.</li>
                                <li><strong>Edge Care:</strong> Be cautious when cleaning the edges of the mirror as excessive moisture or chemical exposure can weaken the mirror’s backing and lead to peeling or discoloration over time.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Care for Colored Frames:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Avoid All Cleaning Agents on Frames:</strong> Colored frames around mirrors, especially those with a finish, can easily be damaged by cleaning chemicals.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Recommended Cleaning Method:</strong> The frame should only be wiped down with a <em>soft, dry, or slightly damp cloth</em>. Avoid using any cleaning agents on the frame to maintain its color and integrity.</li>
                                <li><strong>No Water Exposure:</strong> Be cautious about letting water or moisture accumulate around the frame, as prolonged exposure can affect both the color and the material of the frame.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Warranty Disclaimer:</h6>
